what does fingerprinting even mean?
something here about density of fingerprints
real time vs. offline and why I chose offline
	offline is more secure (and less creepy) 
benefits and drawbacks of fingerprinting vs algorithmic determinations:
	fingerprinting requires a map
	algorithmic determinations require knowledge of distances between access points, which is harder to get than a fingerprint map, and is not as forgiving of signals bouncing off stuff
